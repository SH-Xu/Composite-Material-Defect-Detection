The main purpose of this repository is to share the GUI. So to protect the privacy, the self-made data is not given. You can use the original dataset from https://github.com/abin24/Magnetic-tile-defect-datasets. with trained model parameter from https://github.com/MitraDP/Detection-of-Surface-Defects-in-Magnetic-Tile-Images to replace the dataset and model parameter in this repository instead.
